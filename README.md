This repository contains the implementation and replication study for **Paper 3** in the DS340W course.
The project reproduces the methodology from *Unsal-Altuncan & Vanhoucke (2023)*, combining **Monte Carlo simulation** and **Bayesian Network modeling** to analyze project schedule and cost uncertainty using synthetically generated project networks.

## Overview

The project implements the following workflow:

1. **Phase 1: Baseline Computation (PD)**

   * Parses `.rcp` files generated by RanGen2.
   * Computes critical path lengths (planned durations).

2. **Phase 2: Network Topology Metrics**

   * Derives structural indicators (Serial/Parallel, Activity Distribution, Topological Float, etc.).
   * Merges with Phase 1 to form a baseline dataset.

3. **Phase 3: Monte Carlo Simulation**

   * Simulates project execution across 9 time–cost scenarios.
   * Produces normalized time (T) and cost (C) performance ratios and uncertainty spreads.

4. **Phase 4–5: Exploratory and Bayesian Analysis**

   * Explores relationships between topology, uncertainty, and performance.
   * Trains a Bayesian Network (BN) to model dependencies among variables.

5. **Phase 6: Validation and Forecast Accuracy**

   * Computes MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for time and cost forecasts.
   * Compares simulation-based accuracy against reference figures from the parent paper.

## Running the Notebook in Google Colab

1. **Open the Notebook**
   Upload or open `paper3_code.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

2. **Data Setup**
   At the top of the notebook, run the **data extraction cell**:

   ```python
   !pip install -U gdown --quiet
   import os, re, gdown, zipfile

   shared_link = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/your_shared_zip_id/view?usp=sharing"
   # The ZIP must contain folders like rangen2_SP01, rangen2_SP02, etc.

   match = re.search(r"(?:/d/|id=|folders/)([-\w]{25,})", shared_link)
   file_id = match.group(1)
   zip_url = f"https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}"

   local_root = "/content/project_data"
   os.makedirs(local_root, exist_ok=True)
   zip_path = f"{local_root}/rangen2_raw_full.zip"

   gdown.download(zip_url, zip_path, quiet=False)
   with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as z:
       z.extractall(local_root)

   root_dir = local_root
   ```

   This ensures the `.rcp` files are available for all phases.

3. **Run All Cells**
   From the menu: **Runtime → Run all**
   All output files will be saved under `/content/project_data`.

## Output Files and Interpretation

* **RG30_PD.csv:** Baseline project durations.
* **RG30_NT.csv:** Computed network metrics (I2–I6).
* **RG30_Baseline.csv:** Combined PD and NT data.
* **RG30_Simulations.csv:** Monte Carlo results for all scenarios.
* **RG30_ModelTable.csv:** Final modeling dataset (used for Bayesian and MAPE analysis).
* **RG30_BNEdges.csv:** Learned Bayesian Network structure.

---

## Notes and Recommendations

* Ensure that the shared ZIP file contains all subfolders (`rangen2_SP01` through `rangen2_SP09`) directly within it.
* The Monte Carlo simulation is set to **N = 200** to reduce runtime.
  For higher fidelity (closer to parent paper results), increase `N_SIMS` to 500–1000.
* Outputs are normalized and compared against scenario-level baselines for fair accuracy evaluation.
* Export the notebook as **HTML** (`File → Download → HTML`) to preserve code and results for submission.

Would you like me to add a short **“References”** section at the bottom (APA-style citations for the three parent papers)? It helps if you’re submitting this as part of your written report.
